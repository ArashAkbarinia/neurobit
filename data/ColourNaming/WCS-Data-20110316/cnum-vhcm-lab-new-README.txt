World Color Survey Munsell Color Chip Mapping Table

The file "cnum-vhcm-lab-new.txt" combines into a single table 
the data formerly given in three separate files, and corrects 
several errors. Each line of the "cnum-vhcm-lab-new.txt" file 
has 9 fields. The field header abbreviations are as follows:

1:   cnum    : WCS chip number 
2:   V       : WCS code for Munsell Value
3:   H       : WCS code for Munsell Hue
4:   C       : Munsell Chroma
5:   MunH    : Munsell Hue
6:   MunV    : Munsell Value
7:   L*      : CIEL*a*b* "L*" reference value
8:   a*      : CIEL*a*b* "a*" reference value
9:   b*      : CIEL*a*b* "b*" reference value

Field 1 gives the WCS number for the chip, an integer in the 
range 1..330 randomly assigned to each of the Munsell color 
chips.

Fields 2..6 derive from Hardin & Maffi (1997; ISBN 0521496934). 
This data was input based on the figure on p. iv of the front 
matter (duplicated on the back cover of the paperback edition), 
giving "the specifications of the Munsell color chips that were 
used in the array and in the original color-naming stimuli." 
The hue values are numbered from 1..40, lightness B..I, and 
chroma (saturation) values are even numbers in the grid 2..16. 
Note that corrections have been applied to this data, primarily 
to "5GY" entries.

Fields 7..9 derive from the file "muntable.prn" generated by the 
"Munsell Conversion Software" - Version 6.2 Copyright 2002 
GretagMacbeth, used by permission. Note that ".00R" in 
"muntable.prn" equals "10.00RP" in the current data.

The conversion from Munsell to CIEL*a*b* was done assuming Illuminant C.

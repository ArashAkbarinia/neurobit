%CheckNeighbours  calculating the distance towards closest obstace.
%   Finds neighbours of one pixel and checks their distance towards
%   obstacle, based on those distances you can set the distance of current
%   pixel.

% Inputs
%   map_grid      the matrix of map.
%   pixel         current pixel.
%   connectivity  4 or 8 neighborhood.
%   xcircle       if matrix is circular is x direction, default false.
%   ycircle       if matrix is circular is y direction, default false.
%
% Outputs
%   PixelGradient  the minimum value of its neighbours plus one.

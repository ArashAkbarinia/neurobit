% Inputs
%   MapGrid       the matrix of map.
%   pixel         the pixel that we want to get the neighborus.
%   connectivity  4 or 8 neighbourhood.
%   xcircle       if matrix is circular is x direction, default false.
%   ycircle       if matrix is circular is y direction, default false.
%
% Outputs
%   neighbours  list of neighbours. If x and y of one neighbour is 0, it.
%   means       that neighboru is not valid.

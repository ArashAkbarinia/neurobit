function lsY = XYZ2lsY(XYZ, choice)
%This function attempts to make sense of the multitude of XYZ-LMS space
%transfromations. They are all derived form the xyz colour matching
%functions and the lms cone sensitivity mechanisms, using external
%hypothesis such as the Konig hypothesis (confusion points arise from the
%lack of one of the cone receptor types) and some others (see below). Some
%transformations produce very small S values (this seems to be quite
%arbitrary) while others are normalised to produce equal responses to D65
%light, etc.

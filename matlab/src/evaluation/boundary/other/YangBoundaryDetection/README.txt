USAGE£º

To detect color boundary with the SCO model to an image, 
 run "example.m" for an example.

SCOBoundary.m is the main function for performing our model.

if you want to apply this algorithm to the BSDS300 dataset, you will need to 
download and install the code for applying benchmark, which is available£º

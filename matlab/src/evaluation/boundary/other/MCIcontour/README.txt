USAGE£º

To detect contour with the MCI model from a gray image, 
 run "example.m" for an example.

MCIoperator.m is the main function for performing our model.

if you want to apply this algorithm to the BSDS300/500 dataset, you will need to 
download and install the code for applying benchmark, which is available£º
